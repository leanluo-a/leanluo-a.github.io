<br>I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Linguistics at UC Davis working in the [Morgan Computational Psycholinguistics Lab](https://morganlab.ucdavis.edu/). In June 2025, I obtained my PhD degree from Tsinghua University, with a specialization in child language development. 

I study the mechanisms underlying language and cognition across populations, from infants to adults, with the overarching goal of characterizing the fundamental units and computations that support different cognitive processes. 

My research employs both experimental and computational methods.
